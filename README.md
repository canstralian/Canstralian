# Canstralian

Full-stack. From silicon to cloud. From offense to defense.

## Build

Architecting adaptive systems across the full stack: **FastAPI backends** with **PostgreSQL persistence**, **edge ML** on **Raspberry Pi** and **ESP32**, and **automated security loops** born from CTF research.

The goal: **self-optimizing infrastructure.**  
Vulnerability detection → automated remediation.  
Performance drift → real-time parameter tuning.  
Threat detection → dynamic defense adaptation.

Zero Trust throughout the stack — from hardware isolation to API authentication. Every signal feeds back into the loop.
